# Technical Report



# Managerial Report
**1.	The formation of the team**
Our team consists of five members, leader is Iwan Bin Amri and members are Muhammad Idzhans Khairi, Nor Aniq Haqym bin Nor Azman, Afiq Danish bin Affindi and Rifqi Fahim bin Rohanan. We formed our group by filling up our names in the grouping spreadsheet Dr. Badrul had prepared. Though none of us knew each other, we managed to cooperate with one another over time. The leader was selected after the topic of the assignment was determined. Iwan was elected leader because he had done a similar assignment during foundation which could act as a guideline on what needs to be done. Thus the group was formed and the workload was split up.

**4.	Problems and Solutions**
Problems Faced during the project
```
-	The online learning environment made it hard to get to know each other making cooperation among the group members difficult.

-	Difficulty in keeping track of each group members progress

-	The java programs written by each member could only be run on their own computers because of the libraries and programs required and different directories used. This made some of the earlier versions of the code written by members incompatible with the main program.

-	In order to fulfil the extra features we needed to study more in java topics that are not covered in class such as databases, GUI, QR-code and email-notifications.

-	Difficulty in contacting and meeting each other because 2 of the members do not live on campus and the rest do.

```

Solutions
```
-	We created a WhatsApp group to discuss and distribute the tasks as well as contact each other about the project.

-	We created a GitHub repository so we could keep track of the progress in the project as well as pull the project files that are uploaded by the members.

-	We did research on the extra features by looking up how to do them online

-	We compiled the entire project on persons laptop in order to have the full working program in one place, rather than each person having one part of the project working.

```

**5.	Other Issues**

-	The database for the project is not an online database and only works on our local machine.
-	Only the members on campus were able to do project testing as they had the laptop with the fully working program.
